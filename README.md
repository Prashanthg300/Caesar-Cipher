# Caesar-Cipher

Description:
Welcome to the Caesar Cipher Project repository! Dive into the fascinating world of cryptography and encoding with this implementation of the classic Caesar Cipher algorithm. Explore the art of secret communication used for centuries, where messages are transformed through a simple yet ingenious shift of letters.

Features:

Encryption and Decryption: Utilize the Caesar Cipher algorithm to both encode and decode messages, providing a hands-on understanding of how this historical technique works.
Customizable Shifts: Experiment with different shift values to create your unique encoded messages and explore the impact of various shifts on the resulting text.
User-friendly Interface: The project boasts an intuitive interface, making it easy to input messages, select shift values, and instantly see the encrypted or decrypted results.
Alphabetic Boundary Handling: The implementation seamlessly handles both uppercase and lowercase letters, wrapping shifts around the alphabet to ensure accurate encoding and decoding.
Educational Tool: Use this project to learn about cryptography, encoding methods, and the historical significance of the Caesar Cipher.
Getting Started:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.
Enter a message you wish to encrypt or decrypt.
Choose a shift value to apply to the message.
Click "Encrypt" to transform the message or "Decrypt" to reveal its original form.
